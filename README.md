This service allows users to register a trusts.

The UI is generated based on the following template repository, known as Scaffolds.

https://github.com/hmrc/hmrc-frontend-scaffold.g8

to run locally using the micro-service provided by the service manager:

***sm --start TRUSTS_ALL -f***

If you want to run your local copy, then stop the frontend ran by the service manager and run your local code by

***sbt "run 9781"***

This is a test by Build and Deploy.
